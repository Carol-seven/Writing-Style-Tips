\begin{enumerate}
    \item No space before a paragraph. Use two blank lines to seperate paragraphs 
    and no space in blank line.
    \item Make line width below 80. 
    \item Do not start a scentence with symbol.
    \item No comma and long words in math mode.
    \item Put a space before every left parenthesis.
    \item Explain each symbols after equations/formulas starting with ``where'' 
    so that readers fully understand them. Explanations for one equation/formula 
    should put in one single scentence. No blank line so that no new paragraph 
    is started before or after math mode.
    \item Put captions for tables on top while captions for figures on bottom.
    \item Use ``Table'', ``Figure'', ``Equation'' when cite them. Make first letter 
    be capital and do not use abbrivation.
    \item Do not change font size for tables. Change table layout to fit instead 
    of resizing it. Try to avoid sideways table.
    \item Use past tense to describe the data generation in simulation studies.
    \item Show simulation settings in detail so that readers can reproduce your 
    results. Always justify your simulation settings.
    \item Never use ``h'' in floating table/figure.
    \item test
