# Manuscript style
\begin{enumerate}
\item Always spell check.
\item When revising the paper, answer how the comments are addressed, in blue.
      When the comments are solved, just delete that comments.
\item No space before a paragraph. Use two blank lines to seperate paragraphs and
      no space in blank line.
\item Make line width below 80.
\item Do not start a scentence with symbol.
\item No comma and long words in inline math mode.
\item Put a space before every left parenthesis.
\item Explain each symbols after equations/formulas starting with ```where'' so
      that readers fully understand them. Explanations for one equation/formula
      should put in one single scentence. Never end a scentence with undefined
      symbol. No blank line so that no new paragraph is started before or
      after math mode (Don't put formula alone as a paragraph).
\item Put captions for tables on top while captions for figures on bottom.
\item Use ``Table'', ``Figure'', ``Equation'' when cite them. Make first letter be
      capital and do not use abbrevation.
\item Use past tense to describe the data generation in simulation studies.
\item Figures/tables and other floaters are always positioned with ``tbp''.
      Never use ``h'' in floating table/figure.
\item Label equations, tables and figures which will be referenced and label
      them use informative name. Don't label those which won't be referenced.
\item Label and cite each section if needed. Never use the number to
      represent a section, like ``Section two is about ...''
\item No space in object or identifier (file/project/variable/label) names.
\item Don't repeat title words in keywrods.
\item Use ``citep'' when cite paper with parentheses.
\item In math mode, use different sized parentheses for better view.
\item Define the distribution instead of distribution name only. Like G(a, b),
      don't only define that G is shorthand of Gamma.
\item In math formulas, don't use ``$\times$'' for multiplying unless in a new line.
\item Put enough space in math formulas for better view in source.
\item No inline ``frac''.
\item Use a consistent labeling system, like sec, fig, tab, eq, alg, etc.
\item Do not define unnecessary symbol. Use reasonable and simple symbol, eg,
      don't use $a_1$ if you don't have an $a_2$, just $a$ is enough.
\item Use ``$\backslash$dd'' for differentiation operator. Define new command:
      $\backslash$newcommand\{$\backslash$dd\}\{$\backslash$mathrm\{d\}\}.
\item Cite paper instead of book for appropriate credit.
\item Close the sentence with a period, even in an equation.
\item Never start a sentence with ``And''.
\item Avoid a number starting a new line. Use tilde in tex source file to connect
      text and number.
\item Cite equations through ``eqref'' not ``ref''.
\item Never use abbreviation, like ``don't''.
\item Delete extra empty rows.
\item Don't use bullet points in a paper. Put them in a nice paragraph.
\item No brackets in citing sections/tables/figures.
\item Don't break lines in inline math mode.
\item Use vector form if possible instead of summation.
\item When cite a formula/equation, don't use word ``Formula'' or ``Equation'',
      just directly cite it using ``eqref''.
\item Use a different font for code.
\item Learn how to use ``and'' when listing. Don't use ``$\$a, b\$$'', use
      ``$\$a\$$ and $\$b\$$'' (no comma in inline math mode).
\item Use uppercase letter for random variable.
\item Any equation needs to be part of a sentence. Punctuation are needed.
\item Break long inline math expressions into multiple pieces.
\end{enumerate}


# Figure style
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use pdf or eps for figure file. Don't use png file since it's not vector
      graphics and will lose resolution when resize.
\item For plots with different lines, use different line pattern to distinguish
      them, not only color, so that readers can tell the difference when print
      them out. Same for different dots on plots.
\item Don't use red and green for different in plots. Some people are
      red-green blind.
\item Keep figure aspect ratio correct if the figure has realistic meaning.
      Like a basketball half court should be 50/47.
\item Remove extra margin in plot.
\item When change plot size in latex, keep the ratio fixed.
\item For plot files in tex, name the files informatively.
\item Do not put the figures in an upper level directory. Should be in the
      same directory or a subdirectory.
\end{enumerate}


# Table style
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do not change font size for tables. Change table layout to fit instead
      of resizing it. Try to avoid sideways table.
\item Use booktabs effectively. Never use ``hline'' in table. Use ``toprule'',
      ``midrule'', ``bottomrule''.
\item When display estimatng results, put variable names in a table, instead of
      their coefficients.
\item Protect negative sign in the table.
\item Right adjust the numbers in tables.
\end{enumerate}

# Manuscript content style
\begin{enumerate}
\item In general, open the abstract with a background of the research problem.
\item One sentence about the findings from the real data analysis in abstract.
\item When introduce the model or method you use, directly start from the data
      and then introduce the model, method. Don't write like a review paper.
\item When discussing results, set up a few bullet points on what you see in the
      results. Then say them in a nice flow.
\item Show simulation settings in detail and clearly so that readers can
      reproduce your results. Always justify your simulation settings.
\item Put technical details in Appendix.
\item Use pricise expression. If you can present clearly use less words, then
      don't use more in order to make it longer.
\end{enumerate}

# bibtex file stype
\begin{enumerate}
\item Delete repeated entry.
\item Capitalize first letter of every words in title, except articles,
      prepositions, or coordinating conjunctions like "a", "in", "and".
\item Always check the bibtex information downloaded from website. There might
      be wrong or incomplete information.
\item Use informative label for each entry: "Lastname + First word in title + year".
\item For books, use title style.
\item Protect capital letters using ``$\{\}$''.
\end{enumerate}
